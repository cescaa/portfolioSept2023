          Since I was a kid, I wanted to pursue art—drawing, painting, anything
          that would let me have a creative outlet. But, having immigrant Asian
          parents <i>and</i> attending a small all-girls high school meant my
          career options were limited to healthcare or education.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I went into publishing, thinking it was a good comprimise between
          my creative needs and Ma's needs for my financial security (it was
          not). When I started interning for a publishing house, I was put in
          the one and only team I feared: Web Development. But somehow, my
          teammates and I redesigned their website and I fell in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set aside my romance writing dreams (and nursing according to Ma) to
          pursue a real romance of my own: I went off to study
          <b>Interaction Design at Sheridan College</b> and after,
          <b>Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to create warm and personal products, and believe in designs
          that celebrate individuality without sacrificing user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I continue to learn development and read romance on the side.
          Sometimes, I bake! I hope my long (but rewarding) web development
          journey encourages more women towards tech and make their paths to
          code clearer than mine ever was.
