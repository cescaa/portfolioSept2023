            If you’ve ever argued with someone over politics, you’d know
            changing people’s minds is hard. It’s the same when it comes to
            food; Food is political. As a society, we associate eating animal
            foods with masculinity, and the opposite—veganism—with femininity.
            The term “soy boy” encapsulates these odd perceptions; Internet
            trolls often use “soy boy” to describe men who “completely and
            utterly lack all necessary masculine qualities” (according to Urban
            Dictionary).

            My goal for this project was not only to convince men that dairy was
            harmful to their sexual health, but also to challenge the ideas of
            what it meant to be a man.

          <h5>Target Audience: "Alpha" Males</h5>
          <p>
            Although anyone can benefit from cutting dairy, my target audience
            was straight cisgender men—particularly the self-proclaimed high
            value, red pill-swallowing “alpha” males. Because of animal
            products’ strong associations with traditional masculinity, I was
            interested in exploring the ways I could defy those narratives.

            <p>
              Ads like these promote the narrative that eating animal products
              is masculine.

          <h5>Final Result (Almost)</h5>
          <p>
            Although anyone can benefit from cutting dairy, my target audience
            was straight cisgender men—from the sweet and sensitive soy boys to
            the self-proclaimed high value, red pill-swallowing “alpha” males.
            Because of animal products’ strong associations with traditional
            masculinity, I was interested in exploring the ways I could defy
            those narratives.

              In future, I will modify the landing page's artwork to avoid the
              objectification of women.
