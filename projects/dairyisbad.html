          <p>
            My goal for this project was to create a landing page that not only
            convinced men that dairy was harmful to their sexual health, but
            also challenged their ideas of what it meant to be a man.
          </p>

            If you‚Äôve ever argued with someone over politics, you‚Äôd know
            changing people‚Äôs minds is hard. It‚Äôs the same when it comes to
            food; Food is political. As a society, we associate eating animal
            foods with masculinity, and the opposite‚Äîveganism‚Äîwith femininity.
            The term ‚Äúsoy boy‚Äù encapsulates these odd perceptions; Internet
            trolls often use ‚Äúsoy boy‚Äù to describe men who ‚Äúcompletely and
            utterly lack all necessary masculine qualities‚Äù (according to Urban
            Dictionary). This project is meant to change those narratives.

          <h5>Target Audience: "Alpha" Males</h5>
          <p>
            Although anyone can benefit from cutting dairy, my target audience
            was straight cisgender men‚Äîparticularly the self-proclaimed high
            value, red pill-swallowing ‚Äúalpha‚Äù males. Because of animal
            products‚Äô strong associations with traditional masculinity, I was
            interested in exploring the ways I could defy those narratives.
          </p>

            <div class="imgBox_twoCell">
              <img id="eat_like_man" src="../img/sexist_ad2.jpeg" />
              <img src="../img/sexist_ad1.avif" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Ads like these promote the narrative that eating animal products
              is masculine.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h5>My Own Gender Bias and Design Fail</h5>
          <p>
            In my attempt to break the ties between masculinity and animal
            products, I realized that my methods for doing so were similar to
            those used by the media that first created these associations. After
            user testing the final product among women, I realized that my
            design inadvertently objectifies women in an attempt to appeal to
            the male audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This revelation has motivated me to design future iterations with
            persuasive rhetoric without catering to the "male gaze".
          </p>
          <div class="flexCell">
            <div class="imgBox_oneCell">
              <img src="../img/dairyisbadFull.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
              In future, I will modify the landing page's artwork to avoid the
              objectification of women.
