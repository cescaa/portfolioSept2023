                  My team of three and I developed an interactive transmedia
                  narrative: a story told across various media platforms and
                  artifacts, including a website, a chat simulation, social
                  media, and even 3D models. Our primary storytelling hub was a
                  website, where users had the challenge of unlocking chapters
                  and chapter sections by answering questions. These answers
                  were hidden within the other media platforms and artifacts,
                  requiring users to seek them out. But of course, to make our
                  narrative more fun and engaging, we added red herrings to
                  divert them away from the correct answers. Once users
                  successfully answered all the questions, they were rewarded
                  with the gratifying conclusion of our story.

                  <p>
                    Given that I worked on this project early in my
                    JavaScript/front-end journey and this was my <i>VERY FIRST</i>
                    attempt at jQuery, I want to warn you that <b>my code is
                    somewhat redundant (WET), a bit disorganized, and it may give
                   you a migraine.</b> ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
                    <br />Fret not, I plan to refactor and improve the
                    code in the future! However, I'm still immensly proud of
                    this project, not only because of my contributions as a
                    novice developer, but also because of the remarkable results
                    achieved through our collaborative efforts as a team.

                <h5>My Role and Responsibilities</h5>
                <p>
                  As the Lead Developer, my primary responsibilities included
                  writing the story on our main website and overseeing the
                  website‚Äôs development. In addition to writing half of the
                  HTML/CSS and all of the Javascript/jQuery code, I ensured that
                  the website adhered to the standards established by our team,
                  both in terms of appearance and functionality. Moreover, I
                  took charge of coding a Messenger chat simulation, developing
                  our narrative's "rabbit hole" (which involved using Blender
                  and Unity), and setting up a character‚Äôs social media.
                </p>

                <h5>The Rabbit Hole</h5>
                <p>
                  The pandemic forced us to adapt our rabbit hole: our method of
                  getting our audience to find and experience our transmedia
                  narrative. The user would have to scan the QR code on the back
                  of a physical photo, which direct them to the main website. If
                  not for the pandemic, we would have printed multiple copies of
                  the photo and hid them around our school campus for people to
                  find.<br />To present it to our instructor, I created a
                  rotating 3D model on Blender and displayed it on Unity. The
                  button beneath the photo is linked to a 2D image of the QR
                  code.

                <p>
                  As a busy student, I often didn't have time to prioritize
                  responsiveness for school projects since they were usually
                  viewed on desktop machines. However, responsiveness was
                  crucial for this project because our team wanted multiple
                  participants to test it. This meant I was solely responsible
                  for ensuring our main website was accessible across various
                  platforms.
