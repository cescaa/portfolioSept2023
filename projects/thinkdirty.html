                    My re-designed mockup of Think Dirty's product submission

                </div>
                <h5>Think Dirty App</h5>
                <p>
                  Think Dirty helps users assess the safety of personal care and
                  household products by rating their ingredients from 1 to 10.
                  It empowers users to become conscious-consumers and educates
                  them to make safer and “cleaner” shopping decisions.
                </p>
                <div class="flexCell">
                  <div class="imgBox_oneCell">
                    <img src="../img/td-web.png" />
                  </div>
                  <p>Think Dirty's current website (2025)</p>
                </div>
                <h5>Objective</h5>
                <p>
                  As someone who genuinely wanted to use the Think Dirty app, I
                  was very disappointed. Browsing and searching for products was
                  frustrating; Almost every page overwhelmed me with
                  information; And it didn’t match the company website’s quirky
                  aesthetic. Think Dirty’s poor design makes not only the app,
                  but the entire brand look unprofessional and untrustworthy.
                  <br /><br />
                  So, I took it upon myself to redesign their app, starting with
                  their form for submitting products. This form allows users to
                  send information about a product to the company so it can be
                  rated and added to their database.
                </p>

                <h5>My Tools</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                  <li>Adobe XD</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Think Dirty's Design Versus My Design</h5>
                <div class="flexCell">
                  <div class="imgBox_twoCell">
                    <img src="../img/proform.png" />
                    <img id="chat2" src="../img/thinkdirty-redesign.png" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Think Dirty's design is on the LEFT. My design is on the
                    RIGHT after multiple iterations and rounds of usability
                    testing.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h5>Issues of Think Dirty's From Design</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Colours do not match company's branding</li>
                  <li>Inconsistent labelling of input fields</li>
                  <li>Users must scroll to top to submit</li>
                  <li>Too many category options to choose from</li>
                  <li>Completing the form takes too long</li>
                  <li>Forces users to complete unnecessary tasks</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
                <p>
                  I designed multiple iterations of the form, testing each one
                  against the original design. Consistently, the majority of
                  participants preferred my iterations over the original in
                  terms of speed, understandability, and overall design.
                  However, a common critique I kept receiving was that my design
                  didn’t look as good as the original. Its usability was better,
                  but it didn’t look as “sleek,” “modern” or “trustworthy.” For
                  one iteration, a participant said it looked “really amateur.”
                  While remaining faithful to the brand’s aesthetic, I
                  experimented with the UI until I no longer got those comments.

                <h5>Wizard or Scroll?</h5>
                <p>
                  In my research, I found some participants felt dividing the
                  form in three pages was less overwhelming and easier to
                  understand, but others preferred the one page of the original
                  design because it gave them more control and a better idea of
                  how long it would take to complete. Some also felt it was
                  quicker, even though mine had fewer clicks and required less
                  information. I suspected seeing one page took less effort and
                  cognitive load than having to process multiple.
                </p>
                <h5>Final Design and Outcomes</h5>
                <p>
                  According to my final usability test, my suspicions were
                  correct. I put my design on one page and tested it against the
                  original once more. Compared to previous tests, even more
                  participants preferred my design over the original. Because of
                  these results and because Think Dirty users would be
                  completing this form in store, they may not always have access
                  to a good Wi-Fi connection., I turned my three-page form into
                  one.
